Gesture Controlled car using MediaPipe , Tensorflow, ESP32MicroController

The code was initially written for controlling Pluto Drone (the Drone used in InterIIT 1)
1.0 check [IITIndore-DroneSwarm](https://github.com/IVDC-Club-IIT-Indore/DroneSwarm-InterIIT-2023) using gestures .
But considering the amount of intrinsic drift the drone had , i had to shift to gesture controlled car for now.

Thus you may come across land/up /down commands in the code.
Although the car will only move in 2D :)


To run the system:

1) upload the code on ESP32 (on any other micro controller of your choice), ensure both are connected to same wifi while uploading the code.
2) run car_puppeteer
3) here u go !

other gesture mapping , and details will be updated soon.
