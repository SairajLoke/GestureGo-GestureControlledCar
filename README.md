# GestureGo-GestureControlledCar
Gesture Controlled car using MediaPipe , Tensorflow, ESP32MicroController

The code was initially written for controlling Pluto Drone using gestures .
But considering the amount of intrinsic drift the drone had , i had to shift to gesture controlled car for now.

Thus you may come across land/up /down commands in the code.
Although the car will only move in 2D :)
